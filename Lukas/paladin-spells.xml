            <p>As part of casting this spell, you must expend a hit die or the spell automatically fails. If you do, a writhing lash of coagulated blood springs from your hand.
            This magic weapon lasts until the spell ends. It counts as a simple weapon with which you are proficient, and it has the light, finesse, and reach properties. You can choose to add your spellcasting modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, to attack and damage rolls with this weapon. Its damage die is equivalent to the hit die expended casting this spell, and the damage dealt is necrotic. Each time a creature takes damage from this magic weapon, its maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the damage it took.</p>

                </b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, when you take the Attack action, you can make two weapon attacks, provided both are with this magic weapon. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, when you take the Attack action you make three weapon attacks, provided all are with this magic weapon.</p>

            <p>You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, the next creature hit by the weapon must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive a festering wound. A creature with a festering wound takes 2d6 necrotic damage at the beginning of its turn for the remainder of the spell’s duration. A creature can only have one festering wound at a time.
            Receiving at least 1 point of magical healing closes a festering wound, ending the recurring damage.</p>

                </b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can increase the damage dealt by a festering wound by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

            <p>The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, your weapon shatters the ambient magic surrounding the creature, and the attack deals an extra 4d6 force damage. If the creature is concentrating on a spell, that concentration is broken.</p>
            <p>In addition, any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spells’ level. On a successful check, the spell ends.</p>

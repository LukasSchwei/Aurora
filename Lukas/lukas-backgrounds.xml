            <p>You have taken drinking as your main profession.  The reasons used to be important, but time and the company of your vice have blurred those lines changing their meanings into a distant vague nightmare that only haunts your dreams.  Were you a soldier that has been scarred but the tragedies of war, a merchant that lost everything, or just someone that got lost in the party and decided to live that way forever?  Are you the life of the party, or do you disappear into the farthest corners of the tavern to wallow in your self created darkness?  You first stop in any town will almost always be the closest pub, tavern, or inn for a drink, and with that barkeeps can tell your type the minute you walk through the door.  You can talk your way into any group for a free drink, and are willing to put on a good show to earn it.  Being the Drunkard does have its advantages.  You have talked to so many different people and races that you have picked up a thing or two, sadly those things were picked up while drinking and have a tenancy to be a bit fuzzy.  You have also developed the keen ability to hold your alcohol, and with your Preserved Innards a few other perks.</p>

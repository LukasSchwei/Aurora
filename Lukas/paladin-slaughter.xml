            <p>The only truth of war is death. The only virtue is to kill. The only victory is to survive. Heroism, honor, and glory are illusions. This is the creed of Tormach, Arch-Daemon of War, but this philosophy rings true for any warrior who devotes themselves, body and soul, to the thrill of combat and the delight of bloodshed. Such champions find themselves at the forefront of armies, using the most violent methods at their disposal to bring battles to a swift close… or drawing out the war to sate their own appetites.</p>
